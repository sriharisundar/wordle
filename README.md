# A Rust based wordle game app
I am learning Rust and have recently also got on the wordle train, so I wanted to learn Rust by developing this game. The idea is to have it be installable on the command line, and show all the colors etc. To begin with, I will be using [tabatkins/wordle-list](https://github.com/tabatkins/wordle-list). Later I want to use any dictionary crate to ask the use what word length they want to use and generate words from there. 

Long term goals:
1. Install via cargo as an app.
2. Have an embedded database to track progress etc.
3. Provide the option to play the wordle game if the (any) terminal is opened for the first time in the morning, and store the word and other data.
